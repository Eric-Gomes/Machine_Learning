# Artificial Intelligence Classifier Development, Optimisation and Selection Document Findings

This Machine Learning Experiment required us to carry out the design and development to work on a decision-making system.

Two ways this experiment took place was by using an Artificail Neural Network and a Decision Tree Algorithm to train and test the data.
